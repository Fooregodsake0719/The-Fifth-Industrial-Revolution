  "Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with heat, work, and temperature, and their relation to energy, radiation, and physical properties of matter.",
  "The four-bar linkage is the simplest movable closed-chain linkage, consisting of four bodies, called bars or links, connected in a loop by four joints.",
  "Stress is the internal force per unit area that a material experiences in response to an applied load, while strain is the resulting deformation.",
  "A planetary gearset consists of one or more outer gears, or planet gears, revolving about a central sun gear.",
  "Pascal's Law states that pressure exerted anywhere in a confined incompressible fluid is transmitted equally in all directions throughout the fluid.",
  "Heat transfer occurs via three primary mechanisms: conduction, convection, and radiation.",
  "Kinematics is the study of motion without considering the forces that cause it, focusing on position, velocity, and acceleration.",

  /* COMPUTER SCIENCE */
  "An algorithm is a finite sequence of rigorous instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.",
  "Big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.",
  "A compiler is a special program that translates a programming language's source code into machine code or bytecode.",
  "Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data, such as arrays and trees.",
  "Encapsulation is the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, restricting direct access to some components.",
  "The Von Neumann architecture describes an electronic digital computer with a processing unit, a control unit, memory, and I/O mechanisms.",
  "Recursion in computer science is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem."
